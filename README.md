## Objectives

The objectives of this project was to design, specify, implement and validate **2 RESTful APIs**. Namely, the goal was to use:

* **Spring Boot**, **Spring Data**, **Spring MVC** and **Spring Data** for the implementation of the endpoints and of the persistence;
* **Swagger** (**Open API**) to create a formal documentation of the REST APIs (this formal documentation has to be used in the development cycle);
* JSON Web Tokens (**JWT**) to secure the RESTful endpoints;
* **CucumberJVM** to implement BDD tests.
